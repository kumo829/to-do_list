# This file uses the version 2 docker-compose file format, described here:
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#version-2
#
# This runs the zipkin and zipkin-mysql containers, using docker-compose's
# default networking to wire the containers together.
#
# Note that this file is meant for learning Zipkin, not production deployments.
